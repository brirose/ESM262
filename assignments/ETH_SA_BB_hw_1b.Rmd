## Overall Program Contract

Calculate a wildfire vulnerability index using census data, spatial data, and information from the literature regarding wildfire history and social vulnerability.

*Inputs*: Census data, Spatial data

*Parameters*: Vulnerability parameters from literature (prioritization coefficients), Wildfire history (spatial/temporal)

*Outputs*: Wildfire vulnerability index

*Modules*:

- 1. Filter data by year and location
- 2. Normalize variable per capita & calculate census tract averages
- 3. Rank & compare variables across census tracts

### Module contracts:

##### Module 1. 
The census data is pulled in and cleaned using tidycensus() and then clipped to the region of interest. 

*Output*: Masked shapefile of region of interest with socioeconomic data.

##### Module 2. 

Census tracts, particularly in rural areas, can vary greatly in size and population. Data inputs need to be scaled to a per-capita basis to be compared across census tracts.

*Output*: Shapefiles with associated socioeconomic data scaled and averaged to area and population.

##### Module 3.
Rank & compare variables across census tracts by ranking normalized variables of interest (from module 2), vulnerability parameters from literature and fire history (external parameters).

*Outputs*: Spatially referenced vulnerability index 

*Meta-modules*:

- Find max and min for each variable of interest 
- Rank spatial cells into bins
- Use parameters to modulate importance of variables
- Sum ranks for each bin
